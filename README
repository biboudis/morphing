Thank you for downloading the Code Morphing project.  Code Morphing is
a research project being developed at Georgia Instituted of Technology
and University of Oregon.  The current morphing language being actively 
developed is MorphJ (or MJ), a morphing language extension for Java.

*************************************************************************
Getting started with the BINARY download

Contents of the binary download:

directories
- morphing/MJ/MJBackend/src
    - include executable jar MJCompiler.jar
- morphing/MJ/examples: includes some example MorphJ files
- morphing/MJ/testcases: includes some test files.

To use:

Option1:
- Put morphing/MJ/MJBackend/src/MJCompiler.jar in your CLASSPATH
- invoke:
  java main.MJCompiler [files|directories]

For all compiler options, run:
  java main.MJCompiler

Option2:
- You can directly invoke MJCompiler.jar as an executable jar file.
  Change into the directory containing MJCompiler.jar, invoke:

  java -jar MJCompiler.jar [files|directories]

For all compiler options, run:
  java -jar MJCompiler.jar


*************************************************************************
Getting started with the SOURCE download

Contents of the source download:
- morphing/JastAddJ: includes the Java compiler built using JastAdd.  
- morphing/MJ/MJFrontend: source files for MJ frontend parsing and type checking
- morphing/MJ/MJFrontend: source files for MJ backend classfile generation.
- morphing/MJ/examples: includes some example MorphJ files
- morphing/MJ/testcases: includes some test files.

To build:
- Change into morphing/MJ/MJBackend/src
- run: ant build

To use:
- First, put in CLASSPATH:
  morphing/MJ/MJBackend/src
  morphing/MJ/MJBackend/thirdparty/asm-all-3.1.jar

- Run:
  java main.MJCompiler [files|directories]

To see all compiler options:
  java main.MJCompiler

RELEASE NOTES:

Version 0.21 06/04/2008

- 


Version 0.11 

- This is the initial release and by no means perfect or well-tested.  All files
in the examples and testcases directory runs. But there are many features not 
yet tested or developed. Among them:
  - modifier access checking of morphing code is not complete
  - reflectively declared statements do not handle try/catch blocks, loops,
    or any statements whose bytecode involve labels.

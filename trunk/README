RELEASE NOTES:

Version 0.11 

- This is the initial release and by no means perfect or well-tested.  All files
in the examples and testcases directory runs. But there are many features not 
yet tested or developed. Among them:
  - modifier access checking of morphing code is not complete
  - reflectively declared statements do not handle try/catch blocks, loops,
    or any statements whose bytecode involve labels.

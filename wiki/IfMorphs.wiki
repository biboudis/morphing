#summary if morphing declarations work mostly like for declarations, but they only make a single iteration.

If morphs only make a single declaration, based only upon whether or not at least one member of the morphed class exists that matches their patterns.  They can have secondary patterns in addition to their primary pattern exactly as for iterations can, but an if morph does not bind the iteration variables in the method or field declaration itself.
